# CS263-Python-Comparison

## This is final project for CS263

# Progress:
   # Week 6:
	We found another way to test the memory usage of python program with the tool of memory profiler. This one can be easily installed on our machine without complicated environment setting. We planed to use this tool for memory usage analysis and compare it with BCC.
	We meet challenge in BCC, the speed is low and it cannot work for multiple interpreters, so we try another way to test performance.
	We start using Cpython to test all interpreters.
