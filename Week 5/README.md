## Progress:
  ## Week 5:
	BCC Installation
	Credits to the repo of https://github.com/iovisor/bcc. With BCC tool, we are able to retrieve the performance data of python program in a more formal way. Since it requires Linux environment to install, in this week, we try to use AWS Linux environment to install the BCC tool.
