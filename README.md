# CS263-Python-Comparison

## This is final project for CS263

# Progress:
  # Week 3:

    1, configuration
    2, simple example try
    3, tool try
      timeit
      tracemalloc
      cProfile
      memory_profiler
      based on Cpython


  # Week 4:
  
    1. VMware setting
    2. BCC
   
  # Week 5:
    1. BCC Installation
      Credits to the repo of https://github.com/iovisor/bcc. With BCC tool, we are able to retrieve the performance data of         python program in a more formal way. Since it requires Linux environment to install, in this week, we try to use AWS           Linux environment to install the BCC tool.
    2. Correct Username commit
      We re-commit some files due to the username issues for zhicheng zhang since the username setting is not correct in             previous commits and it did not display contribution correctly.
   
   # Week 6:
   1. Memory Profiler
       We found another way to test the memory usage of python program with the tool of memory profiler. This one can be easily installed on our machine without complicated environment setting. We planed to use this tool for memory usage analysis and compare it with BCC.
