# CS263-Python-Comparison

## This is final project for CS263

## Progress:
   ## Week 7:
	This week, we change our ideas and get huge progress. Firstly, as the other interpreter, such as pypy, cannot use the same tool of Cpython, and it is unfair to use different tools. So, we want to use Cpython to test all the interpreters. So, we did the following things:
	1. Build a script of Cpython that use Cpython to test all other interpreters.
	2. Get the performance in Cpython based on the subprocess.
	3. Use psutil to test the Elapsed time, memory usage, CPU time, CPU_load.
	4. Use memory_profile to test memory.
	5. Use cProfile to get time.
